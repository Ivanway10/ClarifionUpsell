This GitHub project represents a challenge undertaken for a job opportunity. The challenge involved transforming a design from Figma into a functional web page using HTML5 and CSS. The design was provided, and I had the flexibility to choose the technology stack for development.

Project Progress:

HTML5 Structure: The project began with the creation of the HTML5 structure to represent the web page's layout and elements.

CSS Styling: Initially, the CSS styling was applied directly within the HTML file for rapid development. This approach, although expedient, is considered a suboptimal practice.

Asset Integration: Assets, such as images and icons, were downloaded and integrated into the HTML5 structure.

GitHub Repository: The entire project was uploaded to GitHub to facilitate version control and collaboration.

CSS Refactoring: The next step involved separating the CSS styling from the HTML structure. This step is essential for maintainability and scalability.

Responsive Design: Planned future steps include identifying different sections of the web page, such as the navigation bar, cards, footer, etc., and implementing media queries to ensure responsiveness across various devices.

Angular Integration: For further enhancements and code organization, the plan was to introduce Angular, a robust front-end framework.

Project Realities:

The project's scope and timeline were significant challenges, especially considering the complexity of making the webpage responsive and integrating Angular. As a result, the decision was made to pause development. It's important to note that quality work requires time and effort, and in professional settings, compensation for such efforts is expected.

I hope recruiters understand that this decision is not about competence but rather a recognition that quality work deserves fair compensation. If you seek a job well done, it's only fair to invest in it accordingly.
